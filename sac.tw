Darkness. All-engulfing darkness.<br/>

A person you've known for all of your life switches on the lights in the dingy garage. You see the family van, beat up and full of character.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s time,” the person next to you says. You know. You've known when  the evil creatures of the forest came closer and closer to the houses every night; when it wasn't safe anymore to travel without a gun. You've known since you've learned about your family's importance.<br/>
<br/>
Something pokes you on the side. It's a few bills of money.<br/>
“Just take it already. It’s <<= $resources.money >> € we collected for you.”<br/>

You enter a low chamber, deep underneath the roots and soil of the forest. It is illuminated by torches and four other hooded figures holding them. Their soot blackens the moist ceiling as you are led to a block of solid granite in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
You strip bare and lay face up onto the stone. It's terribly cold and wet but you don't care anymore. With a deep breath you close your eyes for a moment, try to calm yourself as you hear the hooded congregation recite verses in an otherworldly tongue.<br/>
<br/>
“I'm sorry,” one whispers in your direction.<br>
“Don’t be,” you whisper back.<br/>
“Sacrifices must be made,” your voice dry and as cold as the steel of the dagger with the undulating blade that’s being thrust into your chest.<br/>
