[if $chat === 1]
"Well well, what did I say about keeping your mouth shut?" - the Janitor starts speaking."
"What are you saying? that is unpossible" - says the lieutenant - "I mean impossible, you can't possibly be evil!"
"I have to now take over this institution right now, as I have no time, and the reign of Jim Pickens is now here."

[["Jim Pickens?" you shout.]]

:: Yes Dear Leader
You help Jim Pickens reign over the world forever.

[if $hair === 1]
